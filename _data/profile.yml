  Xinting (Xenia) Liao is a Vector Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a Postdoctoral Researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. At Vector, she is advised by Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sdENOQ4AAAAJ">Xiaoxiao Li</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o1XZyLMAAAAJ">Deval Pandya</a>, where her research centers on federated learning on foundation models and out-of-distribution robustness, and she actively contributes to the peer-review process for top conferences including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, CVPR, ACM MM, TPAMI, and ACL ARR. 

  She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University in June 2025, where she was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MY23M60AAAAJ">Xiaolin Zheng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qZTMyzwAAAAJ">Chaochao Chen</a>, and concurrently participated in the Joint Ph.D. Program with the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Z9DWCBEAAAAJ">Tat-Seng Chua</a>, in close collaboration with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Ma5DtmoAAAAJ">Wenjie Wang</a>. 

#  Her doctoral research explored trustworthy machine learning, with emphasis on federated learning under non-IID data, privacy-preserving algorithms, and cross-domain recommendation systems.

#  Her current research interests include federated learning on foundation models, out-of-distribution robustness, and broader aspects of trustworthy machine learning.
